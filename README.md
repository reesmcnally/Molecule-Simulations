# Molecule-Simulations
Storage for simulations used for my PhD work in the ZLab.

Chirp Slowing and White Light:
These simulations model the propogation of individual particles, generated from a cryogenic buffergad beam source using Monte-Carlo methods. Initial position and velocity is selected from thermal distrbutions, and a gaussian forward velocity along the beam propogation direction.

Laser slowing of the beam (using a few different techniques) is modeled as a force, which depends on an individual particles forward velocity.This is useful to design laser cooling and slowing experiments.
